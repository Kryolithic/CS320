How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

As a developer, we must always keep the satisfaction of the end user at the forefront of our minds and any design decisions should be made to enhance the well-being of the end user. A major contributing factor to client satisfaction stems from the ability to deliver a product that is both functional and secure. We are able to ensure these conditions are met through the implementation of a testing phase which has sufficient coverage to give both the development team and the end use confidence in the product. In order to enable the implementation of these tests, it is imperative that the code we create is organized, efficient, and compliant with industry standards. 

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

Another contributing factor to the end users' satisfaction with the delivered product will arise from how well we managed to interpret their needs and wishes. Before any project is initiated, one must first gather all necessary requirements from the client and clearly document these requirements for the planning phase of development. Once the requirements are clearly and plainly defined, we can then begin to formulate a plan on how we can meet these requirements. In a sense, you have to know what you need to make before you can make it.

How do I approach designing software?

I approach software design from the perspective of the end user. When creating a product, I always strive to envision the experience of the end user or client as they use my application. If I can understand the benefits and difficulties that the end user may experience with my application, I can then work to alleviate the negative impacts and build upon the positive. Whenever you are in the business of creating something for others to use, the most important skill one can possess is the ability to empathize with the intended clients.
